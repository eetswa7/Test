# Graphics and controls revision — 2026-09-06

Implemented: original texture/foliage/sky assets, detailed weapon and character models, map dressing, WebGL lighting and postprocessing, textured compatibility graphics, corrected 4× scopes, simpler two-thumb controls, context interactions, automatic empty reloads and safe control placement.

Release verification: 42 regression tests pass. Static checks validate 21 modules, mesh winding, assets and complete offline shell. ES modules and CSS use release URLs; service-worker v6 preloads all game modules and textures.

Prior browser checks covered menus, touch actions, loadouts, scoped view, responsive layouts and match flows using compatibility graphics. Final browser recheck was blocked by the environment URL policy. WebGL shader runtime, physical iPhone FPS/thermals, gyro and controllers still require device validation. No measured 60 FPS or commercial-game visual parity is claimed.

This repository retains the original five bot modes, four maps, twelve firearms plus blade, equipment, local progression, developer tools, and complete match/replay flow. No missing external assets or native build dependency is introduced.

## Fast follow-up — 2026-09-07

Checkpoint 1: fixed recoil recovery at vertical aim limits, respawn first-shot state, disabled-storage launch, corrupt saved control positions, and release of completed spatial-audio nodes.

Checkpoint 2: dynamic instance-buffer sizing, lighter character bevels, reduced redundant AI sight checks, adaptive shadow fallback, per-frame scope overlay alignment, soft billboard smoke/fire and impact dust, map-tinted ambient light and material weathering.

Checkpoint 3: soft character contact shadows, scalable reload/swap controls, explicit asset-download retry, lower results-screen work, wake-lock cleanup on replay/results, and corrected objective handover/FFA awareness.

Final verification: six focused regressions added for recoil, respawn accuracy, inaccessible/corrupt saves, audio cleanup and instance capacity. Release URLs and offline cache advance to v7. Full suite: all 48 tests passed. Static validation passed for all 21 modules, geometry, assets and offline shell. Physical iPhone/WebGL runtime validation remains outstanding.

## Three.js expansion

Checkpoint: player-relative ALLY/ENEMY HUD labels with different shapes and colours, line-of-sight gating, explicit scoreboard team labels, dynamic map counter, and fallback projection support. Renderer, arsenal and additional content are being prepared independently for integration.

Checkpoint: integrated the 13 rebuilt weapon models and animated mechanisms, individual synthesized audio, Breakwater and Citadel maps, Hardpoint and Kill Confirmed with bot objectives, relative-team uniforms, and objective HUD. Pinned and vendored official Three.js 0.180.0 with its MIT licence. Renderer integration and release-cache migration follow.
